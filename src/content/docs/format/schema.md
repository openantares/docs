title: "JSON Schema"
description: The machine-readable JSON Schema for .ant records, served byte-for-byte at its normative $id URL — openantares.org/schema/ant.schema.json.
---

The `.ant` format ships a [JSON Schema (draft 2020-12)](https://json-schema.org/) describing **one decompressed NDJSON line** of a `.ant` stream — every record kind, the trailer's count vocabulary, and the full typed property-value grammar. Container-level rules (manifest first, trailer last, the SHA-256 over preceding lines) cannot be expressed per-line and live in the [specification](../spec/), which owns them.

## The normative URL

The schema's `$id` is:

```text
https://openantares.org/schema/ant.schema.json
```

Since format 0.5 the document is **generated from the canonical implementation's Rust types** — the record enum, the payload structs, the status variants and the sampling rule table — and the canonical repository's CI regenerates it and fails on any difference, so the schema cannot drift from the writer. That URL is the schema's permanent identifier — it is what the published crates and bindings reference — and this site serves the schema document at exactly that path, byte-for-byte identical to [`schema/ant.schema.json`](https://github.com/openantares/ant/blob/main/schema/ant.schema.json) in the `openantares/ant` repository:

```sh
curl https://openantares.org/schema/ant.schema.json
```

Earlier releases were published under a versioned name, `ant-0.1.schema.json`; that document stays served for anything still referencing it, but the unversioned `$id` above is the identifier every current release carries — the schema for format 0.7 lives there today, and a later minor replaces it in place.

## Using it

Decompress a `.ant` file (it is a standard zstd stream) and validate each line against the schema. The Python reference runner does exactly this when the `jsonschema` package is installed — see [Conformance](../conformance/). Two things the schema deliberately encodes:

- **Unknown record kinds are valid.** Any object with a string `kind` outside the known vocabulary matches the `unknown_kind` arm — forward compatibility is part of the contract, and a validator that rejects unknown kinds is wrong.
- **The property-envelope rule is structural.** An object is a typed-value envelope only when it has exactly the two keys `$ant` and `v` and `$ant` names a known tag; the `propertyValue` definition excludes the envelope shape from the plain-document arm so exactly one arm matches.

## The schema

Those are the mutable graph planes — a vertex is a current-state record and deleting one is a normal operation. Observations are append-only by design: an observation is a claim that something was seen at a time, and un-saying it would break the audit trail the format exists to carry. Evidence and beliefs are likewise not tombstoned here — evidence is the justification other records cite (deleting it would strand them, and the closure checker would rightly call the file broken), and beliefs are derived state that a re-materialisation regenerates. If retraction is ever needed on those planes it should be a RETRACTION record carrying a reason, not a delete — a different feature with different semantics. # Conflict rules * Tombstone for an id that does not exist locally → **no-op**, not an error. Imports are meant to converge from any starting point, and a file may legitimately carry a deletion the destination never saw the creation of. * A live record NEWER than the tombstone → **the record wins, the delete is ignored**. `deleted_at` is compared against the live record's last-write time; a stale tombstone must not resurrect a deletion that a later write already undid.
